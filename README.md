Purpose:
A platform known as an online voting system enables organisational members to 
submit their votes digitally through a website, a smartphone app, or any other 
internet-connected device. Using the online voting method, records of voters, 
candidates, and results are kept. This solution reduces workload, saves time, makes 
information available when needed, and secures data. Online voting can also 
increase voter participation. Voters may find it simple to feel cut off from the routine 
practise of casting their ballots. However, they may view the results immediately 
while voting online, which increases their sense of involvement.

FEATURES:
Our code includes the following features:
1.An admin block with access to all information and the ability to input information 
about candidates, the number of voters, and the year in which election was 
conducted.
2.Our system also informs us how many votes each contender receives and who 
wins.
3. Given the goal of our course, our project is entirely focused on the 
fundamentals/logics of programming.
4. it also includes restrictions for voters to only vote once making voting independent 
of manipulation.
